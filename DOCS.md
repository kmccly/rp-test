#Technical Documentation

## Initial design

The **front end** will be implemented with simple HTML, CSS and jQuery. The aim is to keep the client side code light and with minimal design as outlined in the spec.
 
The web application **back end** will be implemented with python. Technical requirements are given in `GET_STARTED.md`. The application is run on the Flask framework for lightweight / fast development.

## Approach

Plan to build out a working front end and then, once the API has been mocked out, implement the back end to support the required search function.
